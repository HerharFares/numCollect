# A Phone Number Scraper

## DISCRIPTION

I had the idea to use phone numbers, and may be sell them online,
but hey no use.  
Any way, I scaped over 180K Algerien phone number, and over 16k French phone numbers.  
The numbers were scraped from online selling websites(like ebay),
***<https://ouedkniss.com>*** for Algeria, and ***<https://vivastreet.com>*** for France. In the algerian website, the phone numbers are stored as images, therefore i had to download the images,so i can extract them later using image to text. The French website was very simple to deal with.  
The phone numbers are stored into CSV, DB end TXT files, you'll find them in the data folder, dataDz for Algeria, dataFr for France, boutiqueDZ.json only a later on idea that contains a list extracted from ***<https://ouedkniss.com>***.  
In the WebSite directory you'll find the scraping code. And some notes and extra code in the use directory.
